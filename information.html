                There are battle royales that can be as small as 10 players but can add to over 150 people. However, Apex Legends has a max of 60 players per game.

                This game becomes very addicting once players are more experienced because harder levels become faster, with more movement and activeness.
                Whats unique about this game is how it is equivalent to working out some parts of the upper body if played regularly.
